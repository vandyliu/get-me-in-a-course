# Get Me In A Course
Python script that uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup4 to check if a course has a spot, and gets in them.

Have a courses.txt in same directory as script.py.
Courses.txt should look like

```
CPSC 330 102
CPSC 317 201
```

It will check each course and register if possible.
Also export your UBC Username and UBC Password as env vars for the script. I did it with loadenv.
```
export USER=johndoe
export PASSWORD=badpassword123
```

To also get text notifications, you must also export:
`PHONE_NUMBER=+1604XXXXXXX`
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ABCDEFGHILJK`
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=ABCDEFGHILJKABCDEFGHILJK`

Types of seats still needs to be worked on. Can add something in courses.txt to signify which type of seat. I'm not going to do that right now because I don't really need to.

Script runs forever. Keyboard interrupt using CTR+C when finished using.
